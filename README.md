- This simple color-extraction tool is aimed at graphic designers who might struggle with finding specific colors in their images
- It helps them fully analyze the image's colors and get all the RGB Values for each color
- The number of colors extracted is determined by the user, go that it's dynamic enough for each user
- Technologies used:
- 
1- HTML, CSS, JS ( Front-End )
  
2- Flask ( Back-End )

3- KNN Machine learning Algorithm ( Color Extraction Model )

Let's take a look at the UI:
1- This is the main, the user is given 2 options to upload images, either by inserting the link to an image or uploading it from their local PC

2- Let's say the user decided to upload an image like here ( Notice the text change in the "Choose a photo" Section:

3- When the user clicks on "Upload and Analyze", they're redirected to this page here where a color histogram with all the colors is shown to showcase the percentage of each color in an abstract way:

4- Right under the color Histogram is a "Color Palette" with all the colors in a square shape, when hovered shows the RGB value of the color, and if the user clicks on it, it copies the RGB value automatically:
